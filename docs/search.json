    "text": "Hello! My name is Samantha Nauman, and I am currently a student at Colorado State University. I am an emerging leader majoring in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability and minoring in Watershed Science in the field of water quality analysis and ecosystem management. While in school I have been involved in the Honors Society and have experience working in natural landscapes. I am most skilled in data analysis, population management, and sustainability evaluations, and my core qualities of sensibility and efficiency contribute to my ability to characterize and maintain the quality of various watersheds and ecosystems. I seek to contribute my expertise to organizations focused on monitoring water quality and preserving populations in ecosystems."

    "text": "ESS474 - Limnology Horsetooth Reservoir Water Analysis: The project consisted of a semester-long data collection, starting from going to Horsetooth Reservoir and using fieldwork equipment such as the van dorn water sample, sonde, plankton net, Lugol’s solution, chlorophyll a sampling, and a secchi disk. Following the collection of water samples, data was able to be extracted from the water. From this project, I learned a lot about how factors such as temperature, oxygen, pH, salinity, chlorophyll a, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen, turbidity, and plankton populations can affect the aquatic ecosystem within a freshwater body of water."
