    "text": "Hello! My name is Samantha Nauman, and I am currently a student at Colorado State University. I am an emerging leader majoring in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability and minoring in Watershed Science in the field of water quality analysis and ecosystem management. While in school I have been involved in the Honors Society and have experience working in natural landscapes. I am most skilled in data analysis, population management, and sustainability evaluations, and my core qualities of sensibility and efficiency contribute to my ability to characterize and maintain the quality of various watersheds and ecosystems. I seek to contribute my expertise to organizations focused on monitoring water quality and preserving populations in ecosystems."
