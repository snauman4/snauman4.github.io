    "text": "Hello! My name is Samantha Nauman, and I am currently a student at Colorado State University. I am an emerging leader majoring in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability and minoring in Watershed Science in the field of water quality analysis and ecosystem management. While in school I have been involved in the Honors Society and have experience working in natural landscapes. I am most skilled in data analysis, population management, and sustainability evaluations, and my core qualities of sensibility and efficiency contribute to my ability to characterize and maintain the quality of various watersheds and ecosystems. I seek to contribute my expertise to organizations focused on monitoring water quality and preserving populations in ecosystems."

Following the collection of water samples, data was able to be extracted from the water. From this project, I learned a lot about how factors such as temperature, oxygen, pH, salinity, chlorophyll a, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen, turbidity, and plankton populations can affect the aquatic ecosystem within a freshwater body of water."

This data was a large dataset measuring the cases and deaths per US county across the lifespan of COVID from its early beginnings to just past the peak. In this, I learned how to download, clean, join, and generate dynamic tables and graphics with the data. The tasks taught me to automate rolling-window calculations, normalize cases per capita, and communicate trends with ggplot2, flextable, and parameter-driven Quarto documents"

We utilized data from the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network, which is a collaborative effort involving more than 2000 scientists and students investigating ecological processes over long temporal and broad spatial scales. Beyond running the tests, I learned to check assumptions (normality, equal variances), visualize results, and interpret ecological meaning from p-values and confidence intervals."

I also learned how to calculate forestry metrics such as basal area, classify trees by DBH (diameter base height), and interrogate long-term growth records to answer targeted biological questions."

With this CAMELS basin data set, I learned to build my first end-to-end tidymodels worflow: downloading files programmatically, merging attributes with powerjoin, exploring correlations, and training multiple regression models to predict mean streamflow. The lab cemented concepts like data splitting, recipes for preprocessing, cross-validation, and visual evaluation with yardstick metrics."

Picking up from that, I constructed a ML pipeline that tested three candidate models, selected the best performer, and carried out Latin-hyper-cube grid tuning on multiple hyperparameters. I finished by finalizing the workflow, validating it with last_fit on held-out data, and mapping predictions and residuals, giving me a holistic view of model generalization."

With collaboration on this project, I learned how to harvest decades of USGS daily data, aggregate it to monthly means, and compare discharge, temperature, and pH between paired protected and unprotected river basins. We employed ANOVA, Welch t-tests, and Tukey HSD to evaluate the influence of legal protected on water-quality trends, reinforcing the link between data science and conservation policy."
