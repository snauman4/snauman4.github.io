ESS474 - Limnology Horsetooth Reservoir Water Analysis: The project consisted of a semester-long data collection, starting from going to Horsetooth Reservoir and using fieldwork equipment such as the van dorn water sample, sonde, plankton net, Lugol's solution, chlorophyll a sampling, and a secchi disk. Following the collection of water samples, data was able to be extracted from the water. From this project, I learned a lot about how factors such as temperature, oxygen, pH, salinity, chlorophyll a, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen, turbidity, and plankton populations can affect the aquatic ecosystem within a freshwater body of water.
