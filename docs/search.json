    "text": "My education at Colorado State University has given me a strong background in skills such as data sampling and analysis regarding various environmental conditions that have affected the quality of the factors involved in building a more resilient water future. I have concentrated on topics such as data analysis, sampling in aquatic ecosystems, ecosystem sustainability, ecosystem management, and population management. Courses completed that provided me with a lot of experience included learning how to analyze and manipulate data in ESS523A with RStudio, Environmental Data Science Applications, and sampling and analyzing the health of the water within Horsetooth Reservoir using RStudio in ESS474, Limnology. Some experience that I feel makes me a strong competitor is currently being a research assistant for the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL) at CSU for Snow Hydrology, where I aided in research on finding ways to improve estimations of snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates using snow depth and an analysis of observed density to improve snowpack bulk density. In addition, I was previously a Water Conservation Intern for the Aurora Water Department for the summer 2024 season, where I practiced water-wise landscaping, repaired irrigation systems, and compiled soil data and plant survivability within the garden from past and recent studies performed."

I am an emerging leader majoring in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability and minoring in Watershed Science in the field of water quality analysis and ecosystem management. While in school I have been involved in the Honors Society and have experience working in natural landscapes. I am most skilled in data analysis, water quality measurements, and sustainability evaluations, and my core qualities of sensibility and efficiency contribute to my ability to characterize the water quality of various watersheds and maintain its current sensors. I seek to contribute my expertise to organizations that monitor water quality and manage ecosystems!"

Following the collection of water samples, data was able to be extracted from the water. From this project, I learned a lot about how factors such as temperature, oxygen, pH, salinity, chlorophyll a, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen, turbidity, and plankton populations can affect the aquatic ecosystem within a freshwater body of water."

In this, I learned how to download, clean, join, and generate dynamic tables and graphics with the data. The tasks taught me to automate rolling-window calculations, normalize cases per capita, and communicate trends with ggplot2, flextable, and parameter-driven Quarto documents"

We utilized data from the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network, which is a collaborative effort involving more than 2000 scientists and students investigating ecological processes over long temporal and broad spatial scales. Beyond running the tests, I learned to check assumptions (normality, equal variances), visualize results, and interpret ecological meaning from p-values and confidence intervals."

With this CAMELS basin data set, I learned to build my first end-to-end tidymodels worflow: downloading files programmatically, merging attributes with powerjoin, exploring correlations, and training multiple regression models to predict mean streamflow.

I finished by finalizing the workflow, validating it with last_fit on held-out data, and mapping predictions and residuals, giving me a holistic view of model generalization."

With collaboration on this project, I learned how to harvest decades of USGS daily data, aggregate it to monthly means, and compare discharge, temperature, and pH between paired protected and unprotected river basins.
